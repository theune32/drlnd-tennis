# DRLND: Continuous Control Project

In this project the goal is to learn how to operate a double-jointed are to move to target locations.

To start working with this project, clone the git repo and run

    make setup
    
in the root.  A `files` directory will be created with the required dependencies in it, together with a venv directory
with the virtual environment to be use (based on python 3.6).

To start working with the environment run

    jupyter notebook
    
and open `files/Continous_Control.ipynb`.  In this notebook (as provided by udacity) you can see some initial
interaction with the Reacher environment, and with that see that the core dependencies are correctly installed.
